                <p> I met Clark last year in April 2021 when he had moved in with some of my friends. When I first
                    met him, he was very quiet and kept to himself. A friend and I invited Clark to do a few things
                    with us and we learned so much more about him. It was during this time that I started to like
                    him. I wanted him to ask me on a date, but he never did so I asked him. We went on a group
                    date with some of my roommates. I really didn’t think we would go on another date, but one
                    week later he asked me out again. We went country dancing on his birthday. Two days later we
                    officially started dating. Things went amazing for that first month. I felt myself falling for him.
                    When that semester ended, he told me that he was going home and not coming back to school.
                    We decided that it would be better to break up then to do long distance. About 5 days later he
                    changed his mind and was going to come back to school in the winter. We decided to continue
                    dating long distance and see where it would go. We did this for 5 ½ months. We had only seen
                    each other in person once during that time. He had come to Idaho to visit, and it was then that
                    we both said I love you for the first time. That was one of the best days of my life. When he got
                    back in the winter, we couldn’t be more excited to be together. We were able to learn more
                    about each other again in person. There were many talks about the future and marriage. In
                    February 2022 Clark asked me to marry him. I was doing a painting for one of my classes and he
                    came in and asked me in the oil painting room. It was the most special moment to share with
                    him. Since then, it has been nothing but love and excitement for the wedding. 1 moth ago we
                    celebrated 1 year of being together. We have learned so much about each other that we never
                    thought possible.      -Shelbie
